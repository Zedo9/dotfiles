#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. For example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the Ctrl+Shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. The value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. The values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap an action, map it to no_op. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no_op

#: See all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: Remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click
#::  it. Finally check if the click happened at the current shell
#::  prompt and if so, move the cursor to the click location. Note
#::  that this requires shell integration
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> to work.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor even when grabbed

mouse_map shift+left click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  Same as above, except that the action is performed even when the
#::  mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal.

#: Click the link under the mouse cursor

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click link

#::  Variant with Ctrl+Shift is present because the simple click based
#::  version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to
#::  disambiguate clicks from double clicks.

#: Discard press event for link click

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

#::  Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
#::  grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
